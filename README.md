# Password-Strength-Checker
This repository contains an Assembly Language project built using TASM (Turbo Assembler). The program evaluates the strength of a user's password and provides feedback to encourage stronger and more secure passwords.

# Features: 
Checks for the presence of:

1-Password Validation: 

2-Uppercase letters

3-Lowercase letters

4-Digits

5-Special characters

6-Minimum Length Requirement: Ensures the password meets a predefined minimum length.

7-Username Validation: Verifies that the password is not identical to the username.

8-Feedback System: Provides specific guidance on why a password is weak and how to improve it.

9-Lockout Mechanism: Prevents further attempts after three consecutive weak password entries.

# Technologies Used:

1-Assembly Language (8086 architecture)

2-TASM (Turbo Assembler)
